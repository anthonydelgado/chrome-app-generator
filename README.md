Chrome Web App Generator by Anthony Delgado

The Google Chrome Web Store is a great place to share your web apps and make them available to the entire Google Chrome Community.

Now with this simple PHP Script you can generate your chrome app in a few clicks!

When the form is submitted the script generates the manifest.json file required and makes a ZipArchive named chromeapp.zip

Then I used a little bit of Java Script to force the download into the users browser. 

On the TODO list is to generate a simple icon based on the first letter of the app and / or curl and save an icon from an icon URL
